# The SubcellularDistribution Pipeline

This pipeline was created by Pearl V. Ryder and Dorothy A. Lerit to investigate the distribution of subcellular structures in fluorescence microscopy data in three dimensions.

The [documentation file](https://github.com/pearlryder/subcellular-distribution-pipeline/blob/master/documentation/documentation.md) provides a detailed tutorial for users.

A training dataset is provided on [FigShare](https://figshare.com/projects/SubcellularDistribution_pipeline/86732).
